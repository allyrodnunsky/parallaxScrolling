      As Maya left the party that her friend's forced her to attend she never
      thought she'd be thanking them for bringing her. The only thing she could
      get out of her head was the dreamy boy who caught her eye. He smiled at
      her and she would never forget the sparkle in his pearly whites.

        She dreamt about meeting this man again. Much to her surprise she
        recieved a knock at the door the following day. It was him. He said his
        name was Lance.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hi Maya! I apologize if I'm interupting, but would you want to go out
        with me. I just can't stop thinking about you"
      </p>
      <p>
        This was to Maya's surprise. How did he find her house? How did he even
        know her name? But Maya agreed and they immediately fell head over
        heels. They spent days together and life was like a fantasy.
      </p>

        Their chemistry was clear from the start and Maya couldn't resist Lance.
        She waited all day to see him and talk to him. Lance seemed intruiged,
        but something was holding him back. Maya didn't understand how he
        couldn't feel the same for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day Lance said to Maya, "I just don't think I have the time to have
        a girlfriend right now." Maya was crushed.

        She couldn't understand what she had done. She tried to ask Lance, but
        he was hesitant to tell the truth. She loved him and she knew it, but
        her heart was already broken. She tried to keep herself at a distance
        but it seemed impossible.
      </p>

    <div class="parallax5"></div>

        She cried day and night about Lance. She couldn't undertand what he had
        done. But one day, everything changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        She's not sure what happened, but Lance called her and asked to go on a
        date. Sparks flew almost immediately. It was clear Lance was struggling
        to pretend he didn't want Maya too.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I love you" Lance stated. His cheeks turned bright pink thinking maybe
        he said it too soon. But Maya responded and said "I love you too".

        They continued to be together forever. Nothing could come between them
        and it was clear it was love at first sight.
